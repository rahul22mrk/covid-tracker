# covid-tracker

Build a Covid Tracker App using Javascript. I have used www.covid19india.org API to fetch the required data and used Ajax Technology to populate the data Asynchronously. It is fully responsive for all screen devices. It can show us the daily cases and the total cases of any state on a particular date.
